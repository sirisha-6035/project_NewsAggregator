      p
        | C is a general-purpose programming language that was developed in the early 1970s by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs.
        | Initially designed for system programming and operating systems, it has become one of the most widely used programming languages.
        | C is known for its efficiency, making it a popular choice for developing system software and applications that require high performance.
        | The language is characterized by its use of keywords, functions, and control structures.
        | C supports structured programming and has a rich set of built-in functions, enabling developers to write modular and reusable code.
        | Key advantages of C include its speed, portability, and the ability to manipulate hardware directly.
        | However, it also has disadvantages, such as the complexity of memory management and the lack of built-in error handling, which can lead to vulnerabilities.
